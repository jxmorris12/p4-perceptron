1. How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
It took me about five total hours.

2. Would you rate it as easy, moderate, or difficult?
Moderate.

3. How deeply do you feel you understand the material it covers (0%-100%)?
About 80%. P4 is tricky.

4. Did you use any outside sources? If so, give attribution here.
No.

5. Any suggestions?
- At first, I was caught up with a high-level confusion: what strings
are we supposed to match? i.e., when should we accept and when should
we reject a string? It wasn't until I read the statement about part 2 
that this made sense. So it would be helpful to add an introductory piece
that specifies that we're matching every string at the beginning.
- I still really think that having some test cases for each solution
would help. Maybe as well as common pitfalls (why is my controller
seemingly hanging for no reason?). P4 is really hard to debug without
expertise; there aren't any print statements! I also thought I was observing
some nondeterminism in my solution for part 3 but couldn't get it to
reproduce and eventually just threw in the towel  and decided it was correct.
That's very frustrating.
